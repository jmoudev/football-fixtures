# Football Fixture Planner

This CLI application enables the user to input a Premier League football team, and get the fixture list.

The API used for this application is at Fantasy Premier League utilising endpoints for [teams](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/) and [fixtures](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/fixtures/).

Additionally, you can add the upcoming fixtures to your Google Calendar.

This project is intended as a playground to use Typer and the CliRunner class to achieve testing of a CLI application.
